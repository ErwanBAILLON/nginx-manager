- üß© **Modular Design**: Object-oriented code structure for easy maintenance

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+ (uses f-strings)
- Nginx
- Certbot (optional, for SSL)
- Root privileges (sudo)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ErwanBAILLON/nginx-manager.git
   cd nginx-manager
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x main.py
   ```

## Usage

Run the script as root (required to modify Nginx configurations):

```bash
sudo ./main.py
```

### Main Menu

The tool presents a menu with the following options:

1. **List configs** - Shows all existing Nginx configurations
2. **Create config** - Create a new Nginx configuration
3. **Show config details** - View the contents of an existing config
4. **Delete config** - Remove a configuration
5. **Quit** - Exit the application

### Creating a Configuration

When creating a new configuration, you'll be prompted for:

- Domain name
- Port (default: 80)
- Mode: proxy (for applications) or static (for file serving)
- For proxy: path and upstream URL
- For static: root directory and index files
- Additional location blocks
- SSL options with Certbot integration

## Examples

### Proxy Configuration Example

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        # ... other proxy headers
    }
    
    # SSL configuration added by Certbot
}
```

### Static Site Configuration Example

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/html/example;
    index index.html;
    
    # SSL configuration added by Certbot
}
```
